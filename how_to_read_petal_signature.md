# 🕮 How to Read Your Petal Signature

The **Petal Signature Generator** transforms your dream or poem fragment into a set of three Sidam glyphs. Each glyph in the signature represents a unique concept, energy, or prophecy within the Sidam world. This guide explains how to interpret each part of your signature.

## 1. Signature Structure

When you click **Generate Petal Signature**, you will see something like:

```md
## Petal Signature:
⧙ Del — Core of Memory Stream
ϟ Petal Spark — Memory Storm Ignition
⧖ Time Ping — Future Recall Thread
```

- **Line 1 (`⧙ Del — Core of Memory Stream`)**  
  - **⧙**: The glyph symbol  
  - **Del**: The glyph’s name  
  - **Core of Memory Stream**: A brief “function” or explanation  

In most cases, the first glyph is your **Primary Glyph** (strongest match), followed by two **Supporting Glyphs** (secondary matches).

---

## 2. Glyph Components

Each line breaks down into three parts:

1. **Symbol** (`⧙`)  
   - A visual character representing a metaphysical concept.  
   - Appears in the generator as a Unicode symbol.

2. **Name** (`Del`)  
   - The spoken or textual name of the glyph.  
   - Often tied to a Petal or aspect of Sidam lore.

3. **“Function” or Explanation** (`Core of Memory Stream`)  
   - A concise phrase describing what the glyph *does* or *signifies*.  
   - Drawn from each glyph’s **function field**.

## 3. How to Interpret Each Glyph

### 3.1 Primary Glyph (First Line)

- Represents the **dominant theme** of your dream text.
- Derived from the single strongest keyword match (or default to Del ⧙ if none).
- Its **function** tells you the core element guiding your dream narrative (e.g., memory recall, transformation, prophetic signal).

### 3.2 Supporting Glyphs (Second & Third Lines)

- Represent **secondary themes** or energies present in your text.
- Combined with the primary glyph, they create a layered “signature” of your dream:
  - The **second glyph** might show emotional or energetic context (e.g., “Memory Storm” or “Energy Surge”).
  - The **third glyph** might show a directional or prophetic aspect (e.g., “Future Thread” or “Pulse of Vitality”).

## 4. Example Interpretations

### Example A

**Input Dream Text:**
> “Last night I swam through a pool of glowing memories, then chased a spark of light into the future.”

**Petal Signature Output:**
```md
⧙ Del — Core of Memory Stream
ϟ Petal Spark — Memory Storm Ignition
⧖ Time Ping — Future Recall Thread
```

**How to Read:**
- **⧙ Del — Core of Memory Stream**  
  Your dream centered on **recalling memories**. Del anchors you in the past.
- **ϟ Petal Spark — Memory Storm Ignition**  
  An **energetic glitch** or surge in memory—your recollections felt intense (“glowing memories”).
- **⧖ Time Ping — Future Recall Thread**  
  A **signal from the future** indicates you are also looking forward, chasing new purpose.

Together, this signature suggests your dream is about **healing old wounds (Del)** through an **energetic awakening (Petal Spark)** that will guide you into a **new path (Time Ping)**.

---

### Example B

**Input Dream Text:**
> “I felt a chill of ghostly secrets circling my mind, then a warm flame of newfound hope.”

**Petal Signature Output:**
```md
⧬ Nel — Vital Energy Surge
✦ Dream — Visionary Whisper
⧩ Qel — Order of Echo
```

**How to Read:**
- **⧬ Nel — Vital Energy Surge**  
  Your dream’s core was a **burst of life** or emotional vitality.
- **✦ Dream — Visionary Whisper**  
  Ghostly secrets appeared as a **dream-vision**, guiding you deeper.
- **⧩ Qel — Order of Echo**  
  A call to **structure your thoughts**, imposing clarity on chaotic visions.

This indicates you’re experiencing an **emotional renewal (Nel)** led by a **mystical insight (Dream)**, which then calls you to **bring order (Qel)** to these revelations.

## 5. Tips for Deeper Reading

- **Focus on the “Function” phrase** for each glyph. It’s the distilled meaning (e.g., “Core of Memory Stream”) that tells your dream’s message.
- **Consider the order**: The first glyph is the dominant theme; the next two add nuance.
- **Combine glyph narratives**: Read them as a mini‐story—e.g., Del → Petal Spark → Time Ping might mean “Heal the past through an awakening that propels you forward.”
- **Use the glyph’s Petal alignment** to tie your dream to specific lore arcs (e.g., if Del is tied to “Memory Nodes,” your dream might be linked to that Petal’s historical narrative).

---

## 6. Expanding & Customizing

- You can **edit each glyph’s `meanings` array** to include more keywords (e.g., “dream,” “vision,” “sleep”) so that “dream” in your text maps to a particular glyph.
- **Add new glyphs** (with their own symbol, name, meanings, and function) into the array to expand the generator’s range.
- Future iterations may include a **modal popup** with the full “function” field and lore snippets when you click on a glyph in the result.
